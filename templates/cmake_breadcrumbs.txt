==== CMAKE AND PROJECTS ====

=== ROOTDIR/CMakeLists.txt ===

# Should have as a minimum

cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 2.6 )
project( PROJECTNAME )

add_subdirectory( src ) # Or where you keep all the source files


=== ROOTDIR/src/CMakeLists.txt ===

# Should have as a minimum

cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 2.6 )
project( PROJECTNAME )

add_executable( EXECFILENAME SOURCENAME.EXT )

=== Building and Running Your Project ===

1. Create & Navigate to ROOTDIR/build
2. cmake .. 	# For "out-of-source" build , build files and executables are sent to ROOTDIR/build # THIS DOES NOT BUILD
3. make			# Makes your prohect according to the make config files generated by cmake
4. The executable should appear in ROOTDIR/build/src
   a. Note that if you built on a USB stick, Linux will object to running the executable, even if you changed the permission +x
      It is probably easiest to just copy the executable somewhere else rather than asking cmake to come up with some kind of 
      post-build file rearrangement action
